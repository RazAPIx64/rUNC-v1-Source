# rUNC v1 Source
rUNC's old source dedicated to it's June 14th 2025 release (until August 2025)

This is a really old build from like 6 months ago, so i do not recommend running this or testing it for your executor as it is a ***REALLY*** inaccurate test.
Most people will either just paste from this or learn from it, i don't really care as i don't maintain the source of it anymore and most naming conventions are dying out anyway.
